## Overview

Improved Devkind's main website by adding new components and fixing key issues. The work focused on both the look and the function of the site. I worked with **Next.js** for the frontend and **Strapi** for the backend.

## Key Features

- **New Content Blocks**: Added dynamic FAQs and process blocks. These can be added and edited from the Strapi CMS.
- **Chat System Migration**: Moved from Crisp Chat to Freshworks Chat. This gave a better live chat tool.
- **Improved Blog Tools**: Added a collapsible table of contents for blogs. It builds from the blog headings.
- **Bug Fixes**: Solved many issues across the site.
  - Fixed markdown tables and other text formatting.
  - Corrected issues with meta data fetching.
  - Fixed problems with the Calendly and Slack integrations.
  - Solved various layout and responsiveness bugs.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Chakra UI, GraphQL
- **Backend**: Strapi CMS
- **Tools**: Docker for local setup, Gitlab

## Challenges and Learnings

- Setting up new components in both the Strapi backend and Next.js frontend.
- Finding and fixing complex bugs like the meta data issue.
- Learning how to use Docker for local development.
- Making sure the website looked and worked right on all devices.

## Outcome

- The website is now more flexible.
- Authors can create richer pages with new content blocks.
- The user experience is better due to fewer bugs.
- Blog readers can now find information easier with the new table of contents.
