## Overview

I built GradAccelerate's new mobile app from scratch. This project also included improvements to their website. The mobile app uses **Expo and Supabase**. It focuses on daily user engagement.

***

## Mobile App Features

- **Daily Quizzes**: A core feature. Users answer daily questions. This helps them learn and stay active.
- **Push Notifications**: Sends a daily alert. It reminds users when a new quiz is ready.
- **User Authentication**: Lets users sign up or log in. It uses a clean, full-screen design.

***

## Website Improvements

- **Application Wizard**: Made the application process a three-step guide with a progress bar.
- **Form Validation**: Added real-time checks to the form using Zod to prevent errors.
- **CRM Integration**: Connected the form to Freshworks CRM to receive applicant's responses.
- **Automation Pipeline**: Set up an n8n workflow to help with shorlisting candidates resumes/CVs.
- **Responsive Design**: The website works well on all devices. It is mobile-friendly.
