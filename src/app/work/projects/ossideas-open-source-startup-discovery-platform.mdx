## Overview

During the bolt.new hackathon, I helped build OSSIdeas. This platform finds startup ideas from open source data. I handled the payment system and user login. I also helped design the user interface.

***

## Key Features

**My Work:**
- **Stripe Payments**: I set up the payment system. It manages subscriptions and different price levels. I made sure payments were secure. I also handled payment events.

- **Supabase Login**: Built the user login system which lets users sign in with email and a password, also works with Google oauth.

- **Website Design**: I made sure the site worked on phones and computers responsively. I used Tailwind CSS for the design.

***

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Login/Payments**: Supabase Auth, Stripe
- **Build**: Vite, Netlify

***

## Outcome

- The platform has a working payment system.
- User data is secure.
- The site is easy to navigate.
- The design looks good on all screen sizes.
