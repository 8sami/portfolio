## Overview

As a core contributor during the Bolt.New hackathon, I led key integrations and UI development for this AI-powered startup discovery platform. My primary responsibilities included payment system implementation, authentication flows, and crafting the user-facing experience under tight deadlines.

## Key Features

**My Core Contributions:**
- **Stripe Payment Integration**
  Built subscription management with multiple pricing tiers, handling:
  - Secure checkout flows
  - Webhook processing for payment events
  - Subscription status tracking

- **Supabase Authentication System**
  Implemented secure access with:
  - Email/password login
  - Google OAuth integration
  - Row-level security policies

- **Optimized UI/UX**
  - Mobile-first responsive design using Tailwind CSS
  - Complex multi-page routing with React Router
  - Interactive components for idea discovery

- **Frontend Architecture**
  - Designed and implemented multiple page layouts
  - Created reusable React components
  - Optimized performance through code splitting

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Router DOM
- **Auth/Payments**: Supabase Auth, Stripe, Row Level Security
- **State Management**: Context API, Custom Hooks
- **Build**: Vite, Netlify

## Challenges and Learnings

1. **Payment System Complexity**
   - Debugged Stripe webhook signature verification
   - Synced subscription status with Supabase in real-time
   - Handled failed payment scenarios gracefully

2. **Auth Security**
   - Implemented RLS policies for data protection
   - Managed token refresh flows
   - Integrated multiple auth providers seamlessly

3. **UI Optimization**
   - Achieved 95+ Lighthouse accessibility score
   - Reduced layout shifts through responsive image loading
   - Standardized component library for team collaboration

## Outcome

Delivered a production-ready platform with:
- Robust payment infrastructure handling real transactions
- Secure authentication protecting user data
- Smooth multi-page navigation experience
- Consistent UI across 50+ device sizes
