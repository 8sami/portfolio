## Overview

I rebuilt the Razalution website from scratch. I used modern tools to make it better. The goal was to improve its look and function.

***

## Key Features

- **New User Interface**: I gave the site a fresh look. I used **v0.dev** to help with the design.
- **Contact Form**: I built a contact form. It sends emails using **SendGrid**, also saves responses to **Google Sheets**.
- **Modern Framework**: The site is built with **Next.js**.
- **Improved Design**: I used **Tailwind CSS** for the new user interface which is cleaner and more modern.

***

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS
- **AI Tool**: v0.dev
- **Email Service**: SendGrid
- **Database**: Google Sheets

## Challenges and Learnings

1.  **Client Requirements**: It was hard to find a middle ground with the client. Their ideas were sometimes not good for design or code. I had to explain the problems clearly. I had to be patient and help them understand.

2.  **Prompt Writing**: I learned how to write good prompts for AI. This helped me get better designs from v0.dev. I made a database of prompts that works really well for redesigning and generating websites by following brand theme and tone.

## Outcome

- The new website is live and looks better.
- It has a working contact form.
- The client was happy with the final result.
- I learned how to work with clients on projects.
