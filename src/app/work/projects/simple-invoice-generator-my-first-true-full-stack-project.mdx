## Overview

This was my first full-stack project. My goal was to build a tool that a real business could use. It needed to create invoices. I had to learn many new things. I learned to build APIs, use Next.js, and work with Django. I found solutions by searching online and reading documentations.

***

## Key Features

- **Full-Stack Design**: The front and back ends work on their own. They talk to each other using APIs.
- **Invoice Tools**: You can create and view invoices. The tool keeps track of all the details.
- **Client and Invoice Tracking**: You can add clients and track invoices.
- **PDF Creation**: It makes invoices into professional PDFs. These are ready to print.
- **User Login**: The system has a secure login. This keeps user data safe.
- **Modern Design**: The site looks good on all devices. I used Shadcn UI and TypeScript.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django, Django Ninja
- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, Shadcn UI
- **PDFs**: ReactPDF for making PDFs
- **Database**: MySQL

## Challenges and Learnings

This was my first time doing most of these things. I wrote my first API. I connected the front end to the back end. It took hours to fix problems. I had to solve issues with data and user login. I learned by reading docs and trying things out. This made me a better developer.

## Outcome

The Simple-Invoice-Generator is a working tool. It helps a business get paid faster. Now, these types of projects do not seem so hard.
