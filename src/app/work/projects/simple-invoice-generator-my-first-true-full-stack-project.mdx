## Overview

This project is where I dove headfirst into the world of full-stack development. The goal? Build a simple, robust invoice generator for a procurement service provider—something that would actually get used, not just sit in a portfolio. I had never built a real API before, never touched Next.js, and Django was just a word I'd seen in tutorials. So, I did what any developer does: I hit Stack Overflow, watched a ton of YouTube, read docs until my eyes hurt, and just started building.

## Key Features

- **Full-Stack Architecture**: Clean separation between backend (Django) and frontend (Next.js), talking over a REST API.
- **Invoice Management**: Create, view, and manage invoices with all the details a real business needs.
- **Client & Transaction Handling**: Add clients, log transactions, and keep everything organized.
- **PDF Generation**: Generate professional invoices as PDFs, ready to send or print.
- **Authentication**: Secure login and user management (because, yes, people care about their invoices).
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Shadcn UI and TypeScript for a modern, accessible experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django, Django Ninja (for REST API), Django Ninja JWT (auth), PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS
- **PDF Generation**: Custom logic for invoice PDFs
- **Other**: Docker for local dev, GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Challenges and Learnings

This was my first time doing almost everything: writing APIs, wiring up a Next.js frontend, and making the backend talk to the frontend. I learned the hard way that nothing works the first time. I spent hours debugging CORS, figuring out how to serialize data, and making sure authentication actually worked. Most of my progress came from reading docs, searching Stack Overflow, and just trying things until they worked. It was frustrating, but also kind of addictive.

## Outcome

The Simple-Invoice-Generator is now a working tool that actually helps a procurement business get paid faster and keep their billing organized. I learned more in a few weeks on this project than in months of tutorials. Now, building APIs, wiring up frontends, and deploying full-stack apps feels way less scary.

This project is proof that you can go from zero to shipping real software if you just keep pushing, keep Googling, and aren't afraid to break things along the way.
