## Overview

I built this Chrome extension for my own needs and CS50x final project. I could not find a to-do list tool that was simple enough. Other options were too bulky or slow. I wanted something that was fast and did not distract me. So I created Taskly. It is fast, simple, and helps with focus.

- **Basic Task Management**: You can add, check off, and delete tasks quickly.
- **Saves Your Work**: Tasks and settings are saved. You will not lose them if you close your browser.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Choose between a dark or light theme. It helps with eye strain.
- **Instant Updates**: The screen updates right away. There is no waiting or reloading.
- **Small Window**: The tool opens in a small window. It does not get in your way.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Chrome APIs**: The tool uses special browser functions.

## Challenges and Learnings

Building a Chrome extension was new for me. I had to learn how manifest files work. I also learned about the storage API. I learned a lot from reading the online guides. I also did a lot of testing and fixing errors.

## Outcome

Taskly is now my daily tool for quick notes. It works just right for me. I learned a lot about how browser tools are made. I now understand Chrome's APIs much better.

The best tools are often the ones you build for yourself.
