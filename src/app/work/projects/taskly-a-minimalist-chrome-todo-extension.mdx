## Overview

Taskly is a ToDo/Note-Taking Chrome Extension I built for myself. Every other extension I tried was either too complex, too slow, or too distracting. I wanted something that opened instantly, let me jot down tasks, and got out of my way. So, I built Taskly: simple, fast, and focused on productivity.

## Key Features

- **Add, Complete, and Delete Tasks**: Quickly add tasks, mark them as done, or remove them with a click.
- **Persistent Storage**: All tasks and theme preferences are saved using `chrome.storage.local`, so nothing gets lost between browser sessions.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between dark and light themes—your eyes will thank you.
- **Instant UI Updates**: Everything updates in real time, no lag, no reloads.
- **Minimal Popup Interface**: Opens fast, stays out of your way, and just works.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For the popup UI and logic.
- **Chrome Extension APIs**: For storage, popup, and theming.

## Challenges and Learnings

Building a Chrome extension was a whole new world. I had to figure out how manifest files work, how to use the storage API, and how to keep the UI snappy and bug-free. Making dark/light mode work reliably across sessions was trickier than expected. Most of the learning came from reading docs, trial and error, and a lot of console.log debugging.

## Outcome

Taskly is now my go-to tool for quick notes and todos. It fits my workflow perfectly, and I finally understand how browser extensions tick. Plus, I learned a ton about Chrome APIs and building for the browser.

Sometimes, the best tool is the one you build for yourself. Taskly is proof that simple can be powerful.
